I had 22 jobs before starting my real estate company with a $1000 loan and built it into a $5 billion business. Today I’m a ’Shark’ on ABC’s hit show \"Shark Tank.\" It didn’t take a fancy degree to get here but took street smarts and a lot of courage. Life is too short to waste your time practicing someone else’s fancy theory on success. I give you the straight talk and the confidence to get there.
